## Notes

**Pricing Rationale**
Plus tier at $4.99 is competitive with other reading apps and accessible for students. Pro tier at $9.99 offers premium positioning below Blinkist ($11.99) but with more value.

**Feature Gating Strategy**
Keep all current features free to build goodwill. Gate new AI features and marketplace to justify ongoing costs. Pro tier targets power users who want data and insights.

**Open-Source Considerations**
Code remains open-source. Paid features are cloud-hosted services like marketplace and AI. Self-hosters can use free tier features only. This model is similar to Supabase and Plausible.
